            <p><b>The internet is a window to the world.</b></p>
                
                <br>
            
            <p>Ever since I took my first step on to the world wide web, I was amazed at what I found - ideas, 
                cultures, experiences that would require many trips around the globe, as well as a lifetime, to 
                know otherwise. From that moment, I was hooked, a happy denizen of a connected world.</p>

            <br>

            <p>When I found myself at a crossroads in my life, I decided to step out - far out - of my comfort 
                zone and learn how to make a presence on the web. It was challenging, at times frustrating, but 
                ultimately rewarding. Once I realized that a computer ins't an evil being, its will set against me, 
                but rather a machine, operating according to its own, albeit curious, brand of logic, I stoped 
                worrying and learned to love web design and devopment.</p>
